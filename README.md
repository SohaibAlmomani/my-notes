[how to learn things fast without going crazy](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-learn-things-fast-without-going-crazy)

> As people who work in the tech industry, we often need to learn new technologies for our work.

- The problem for me with a 12-40 hours course is that it's too much to invest in the tutorial stage, when in reality you want to start building your own things as fast as you can, because the best way of learning is by doing.

- The Crash Course - I usually go to youtube, search for the subject that I'm trying to learn and add 'Crash Course' right after and pick one of the results.

- You might also not see the term 'Crash Course' in the title of the video, but you can see that the video is short enough to be like a crash course.

- Crash courses are great because they give us the big picture of what we are trying to learn, but they don't take very long to finish.

- For example: if you learn Vue.js and decide to build a to-do list(*shocking*) for a project, and now you want to learn react, it's okay to just build another to-do list.

- That is also the time to bring the 'Heavy Guns' like those 40-hrs long courses, or build big and complicated projects which use this technology.
